   I saw some Burma Shave style signs...on the side of the road today: 
 </p>
 <blockquote>
   Passing cars,<br>
   when you can't see,<br>
   May get you, A glimpse,<br> 
   Of eternity.<br>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I definitely won't be passing any cars.

  <li>ipod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li>
  <li>and a protein bar</li>

  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q>
